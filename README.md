# Lobster Marketing Dev Test

https://soham-friends-list.netlify.app/

## Goal

build a react application that displays a list of 10 users from the following API on the home screen:
https://randomuser.me/  

### Acceptance Criteria

* Application should have a Header, Body and Footer
* The header should display the application name
* In the Body, we would need to see the list of all the users. Specifically, we’re looking for their image, first, and last name
* Each card should display users full information using an event
* The Footer needs to contain your name, and a link to your LinkedIn profile

### Guidelines

I would like you to display an understanding of good web design practice as well as demonstrating a solid understanding of React application development, knowledge of the difference between Functional and Class based components as well as their use cases. There is not a set design to follow, but please style the application in a way to give a sense of your artistic proclivity to CSS. 

### Main Features Complete

* [x] Search results should come from randomusers API (free API key: https://randomuser.me/).
* [x] Application should have a Header, Body and Footer
* [x] The header should display the application name
* [x] In the Body, we would need to see the list of all the users. Specifically, we’re looking for their image, first, and last name
* [x] Each card should display users full information using an event, in my case; On hover
* [x] The Footer needs to contain your name, and a link to your LinkedIn profile

### Extras Complete

* [x] All styling and components built using pure css (No component libraries or dependancies)
* [x] CSS animations and transitions
* [x] Dynamic query results

### Notes / Things I would add given more time
* Attempted to create a modal component from scratch using pure CSS and JS but scrapped it due to 24 hour time limit so I could meet basic criteria
* I would add eager loading to the API call
* Create a button that stores the selected users information in local storage so users can save their favorite users for later

### Running
* git clone
* cd into the project directory
* ```npm install```
* ```npm start```
* Go to http://localhost:3000/
